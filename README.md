2025 VLDB Demo

Mauro Famà, Alessandro Ferri, Samuele Langhi, Riccardo Tommasini, Angela Bonifati

## Project setup
To setup this demo, start by creating a directory on your local machine. Any name is fine.<br>
`cd` in that directory and clone the following project https://github.com/riccardotommasini/vis-network-vaadin.<br>
Once done, `cd` in the `vis-network-vaadin` directory and run `mvn clean install` to install the necessary dependencies in your
.m2 maven folder.<br>
Go back one directory with `cd ..` and clone this project.
Your structure should look like this:

main-directory<br>
├── vis-network-vaadin<br>
└── playtowin

After cloning playtowin, `cd` into it and run `npm install` and `mvn clean install`.<br>
You can now run the class `Application` using your favourite IDE :-)
